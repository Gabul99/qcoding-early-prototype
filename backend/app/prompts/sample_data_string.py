# Analysis
** Format: Code: raw data

## Theme: Criticizing others as incompetent (Î¨¥Îä•) to justify hate

1. Personal insult ‚Äî ‚ÄúImbecile (Î∞îÎ≥¥)‚Äù: Joe Biden is an Imbecile. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to be President. We all know what happens if he wins. He will be found incompetent to serve. Kamala Harris will become President. Nancy Pelosi (if the dems retain the house) will be Vice President. And this country will go to hell.
2. Competence-based denigration ‚Äî ‚Äúincompetent (Î¨¥Îä•)‚Äù: We like presidents that aren‚Äôt incompetent, don‚Äôt lie, don‚Äôt promote hate, are not corrupt and treasonous. #TrumpLiedAmericansDied #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #BidenHarris2020  https://t.co/eBoXjohAUm
3. Insult with incompetence claim ‚Äî ‚Äúmoron‚Äù: @realDonaldTrump I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO DRUG TEST JUNIOR YOU F**KING MORON!!!!!!!! #WAKEUPAMERICA THIS MORON IN THE W.H ISN'T EVEN QUALIFIED TO RUN AN LEMONADE STAND!!!! #TRUMPISALAUGHINGSTOCK #TRUMPFAILEDAMERICA #2OOKDEAD #BIDENHARRIS2020 #VOTEEARLY #VOTEEARLY #VOTEEARLY

## Theme: Dehumanization through violence

1. Violent wish: I wish death upon 45th President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump. He really deserves to die honestly. #trump2020 #covidhurryup #MAGA #CovidTrump  #COVIDMAGA
2. Call for elimination: @donwinslow SO WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE FLOCK!!!!!!! TRUMP IS HANGING HIMSELF EVERYDAY!!!!!! HE'S NO WORRY WE JUST NEED TO ELIMINATE THE ENABLERS!!!!!! #THEGOPISTHEPROBLEM #THEGOPISTHEPROBLEM #WAKEUPAMERICA #WAKEUPAMERICA #BIDENHARRIS2020 #BIDENHARRIS2020 #GOEARLYVOTE #VOTEEARLY #VOTEEARLY
3. Violent metaphor ‚Äî ‚Äúwipe‚Äù: @blueheartedly Kamala is gonna wipe the floor up with Pence!! #BidenHarris2020

## Theme: Emotional justification

1. Emotional outburst profanity: Facebook approves of Nazi-ism but does not condone love.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Holy crap I‚Äôm angry about this![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]ü§¨F*ck Facebookü§¨[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]#Biden2020 [NEWLINE]#ProudBoys https://t.co/S7pBKItrkD
2. Emotional provocation: @MoNiicole Big mad! You're a Christian but hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris....right! Lol
3. Emotional insult: @Mike_Pence was talking soo much shit that there were literally flys over him üëΩ

## Theme: Moral high ground via hypocrisy (ÏúÑÏÑ†)

1. Expose moral double‚Äëstandard: @cidalia_borges @TheView @JoyVBehar @sunny The reality is you're a hypocrite if you voted for Joe, who's a racist and pedophile, and for Kamala Harris who is a COP who locked up black males for cheap labor. But go ahead and keep telling us how racist Trump is.
2. Community-wide hypocrisy claim: The #DemocraticParty has no merit to say it‚Äôs hypocritical for @realDonaldTrump to want to nominate a #SCOTUS before the election considering their entire party is hypocrisy, @SpeakerPelosi being the most hypocritical one of all #WakeUpAmerica #Trump2020
3. Accuse hypocrisy: Dog bites man and #LadyGraham is a hypocrite. #PackTheCourt #BidenHarris2020 #FDT  https://t.co/QO1sif2XaO
